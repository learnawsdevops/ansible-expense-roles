### i hadnt given username , password in ansible.cfg still it's able to connect with configurable instances , need to check on this, still templates needs to used in my roles,tags also needs to be used
 
## if all instances under same vpc , and if username and passwords same, if u running ansible command through root user then no need to explicitly pass the username and password
